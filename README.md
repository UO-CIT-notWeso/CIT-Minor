## Welcome to my CIT Minor Portfolio

This GitHub Page will consists of projects and labs from courses I have taken for the CIT Minor at the University of Oregon.

#CIT 281

#Projects:

#Project 1 consists of: 
- Using the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create a number of folders
- Listing the folders in a tree-like structure
- Using the ping command, and practice using the break keyboard sequence
- Creating and executing a JavaScript files using Node.js and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal and Run and Debug

#Project 2 consists of:
- Using the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo)
- Refactor the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring
- Using git via VSCode
  - Creating and using a .gitignore file
  - Diff split screen

Project 3 consists of:
- Creating a "coinage" code module that is capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. After completing the "coinage" code module functionality, update the "server" code file as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package. The updated "server" file will display an initial web page with web links to to test the "coinage" code. The initial web page will be loaded from a file.
- p3-module.js : Code module that exports the coinage functionality
- p3-server.js: Coinage web server 
index.html : Main coin testing web page that issues requests to the web server
package.json : Node.js configuration file
.gitignore : Git intentional file ignore file

Project 4 consists of:
- Creating a REST API that works with a "data" source of questions and answers. Creating all of the code to work with the data source using a code module, and test the code module code using provided testing code. Also creating a Node.js REST API to handle the GET verb. 

Project 5: Optional Extra Credit
- did not submit

Project 6 consists of:
- Creating three classes. The first class is the Shape class that will serve as a base class for the other two classes. The second class is the Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class. A class that inherits from another class can be called the child class of the base, or parent, class. The third class is the Triangle class that also will inherit from the Shape class.The base Shape class will provide the common functionality of a method that returns the perimeter value. Each of the other two classes will provide their own versions of a method that returns the area value. 

Project 7 consists of:
- Creating either an organization-level or user-level GitHub Page, and adding content to this Page. This Page will be the entry web page for your portfolio.
- Creating repos for each of the labs and projects for the CIT 281 class
- Creating a GitHub Page for each of the labs and projects that provides a brief description of the lab or project, and a screen capture
- Adding links to the organization or user Page to each of the labs and projects
